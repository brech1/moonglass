//! Small shared helpers: the store clock, walking ancestry, and
//! [slot](crate::glossary#slot) timing.
//!
//! These are the utilities the handlers and head selection lean on. They do
//! three kinds of job: read the current slot and [epoch](crate::glossary#epoch)
//! from the store's clock, walk a [block's](crate::glossary#beacon-block)
//! ancestors while carrying the payload branch along, and turn
//! fractions of a slot into millisecond deadlines. Each is tiny on its own. The
//! point is that the rest of the module can treat them as settled vocabulary.
