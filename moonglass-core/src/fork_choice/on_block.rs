//! Taking in a new [block](crate::glossary#beacon-block).
//!
//! [`Store::on_block`] is the doorway from the state transition into fork choice.
//! Given a signed block whose parent we already know, it runs the block through
//! the state transition and, if that succeeds, files the block and its resulting
//! state in the store, sets up its empty vote vectors, and records its
//! timeliness, proposer boost, and [checkpoints](crate::glossary#checkpoint).
//! The state transition itself checks and applies the
//! [attestations](crate::glossary#attestation) and slashings carried inside the
//! block. Turning those into fork-choice votes is left to the other handlers,
//! wired up by [`Store::on_block_with_embedded_messages`] for the reference tests.
