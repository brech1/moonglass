//! Adapter for `operations` reference-test fixtures.
//!
//! Operation fixtures share the same state-transition harness. Input
//! operations decode one operation-specific SSZ file before calling the
//! corresponding `BeaconState` method; state-only operations call directly into
//! the state. Missing post-state means the operation is expected to be rejected.
