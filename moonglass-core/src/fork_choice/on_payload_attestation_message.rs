//! Taking in a payload-timeliness [committee](crate::glossary#committee) (PTC)
//! vote.
//!
//! Each [slot](crate::glossary#slot) a committee watches for the
//! [block's](crate::glossary#beacon-block) payload and votes on whether it
//! arrived on time with its data available. A gossip
//! [`PayloadAttestationMessage`] names a single
//! [validator](crate::glossary#validator), but the store records
//! votes by committee *position*, because one validator can hold several
//! positions. So this module's job is to find every position that validator
//! occupies and write its vote into each.
