//! Validator lifecycle and execution-to-consensus request containers.
//!
//! These containers cover deposits, exits, withdrawals, credential changes, and
//! requests created by the execution layer for the consensus transition to
//! consume.
//!
//! The lifecycle path is: a deposit or deposit request enters a pending queue,
//! the validator becomes active, performs duties, may change withdrawal
//! credentials, may request voluntary exit, waits through churn scheduling, and
//! eventually becomes withdrawable. Consensus-layer withdrawals move balances
//! out. Execution-layer withdrawal requests ask consensus to schedule that
//! movement.
//!
//! Validator balances are consensus-layer accounting. Deposits and withdrawals
//! are controlled movements between that accounting and execution-layer ETH.
