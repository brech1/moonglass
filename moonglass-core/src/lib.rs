#![allow(clippy::must_use_candidate, clippy::return_self_not_must_use)]

//! A behavior-first guide to the Ethereum consensus specs.
//!
//! Ethereum consensus is the rulebook validators use to agree on chain state.
//! This crate models the data validators agree on, the signed blocks that
//! propose changes to it, and the transition rules that decide whether those
//! changes are valid.
//!
//! This crate is a readable execution map, not a production client architecture.
//! Its data structures and main function shapes stay close to the consensus
//! specs where that helps orientation, and helpers may use clearer Rust shapes when
//! that makes the protocol behavior easier to follow.
//! The covered surface is the currently wired consensus-specs reference-test
//! surface. `mainnet` and `minimal` are spec presets, not claims that every
//! documented branch is live-network behavior or fixture-covered.
//!
//! Start with a protocol object, not with a file tree. Ask which handler owns
//! the object, which fields it reads, which fields it writes, whether the write
//! is durable consensus state or local fork-choice view, where the current
//! implementation deliberately stops, and which fixture family exercises that
//! path. The core route is object -> owning handler -> reads -> writes ->
//! decision -> boundary -> fixture.
//!
//! # Start by object
//!
//! Follow one route at a time. Each route names the object to start from, the
//! handler that owns it, the state/store distinction to watch, and the fixture
//! family that closes the loop.
//!
//! Block acceptance starts at [`containers::SignedBeaconBlock`], then inspects
//! [`containers::BeaconState::apply_signed_block`] and
//! [`fork_choice::Store::on_block()`]. Watch the state transition mutate a cloned
//! [`BeaconState`](containers::BeaconState) while fork choice caches the
//! post-state in [`fork_choice::Store`]. Fixtures: `sanity/blocks`,
//! `fork_choice/on_block`.
//!
//! Bid commitment starts at [`containers::ExecutionPayloadBid`], then inspects
//! [`containers::BeaconState::process_execution_payload_bid`]. A bid commits
//! consensus state to payload fields and opens any builder-payment obligation. It
//! is not delivered payload evidence. Fixture: `operations/execution_payload_bid`.
//!
//! Delivered payload evidence starts at
//! [`containers::SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope`], then inspects
//! [`fork_choice::Store::on_execution_payload_envelope()`] and
//! [`fork_choice::Store::payloads`]. The envelope passed the implemented
//! consensus-side checks, not full execution-engine or blob-availability
//! verification. Fixture: `fork_choice/on_execution_payload_envelope`.
//!
//! Parent-payload settlement starts at [`containers::ExecutionPayloadBid`] and
//! [`containers::ExecutionRequests`], then inspects
//! [`containers::BeaconState::process_parent_execution_payload`]. The child proves
//! its parent payload handoff, applies the parent payload's requests, and releases
//! the parent builder payment. Fixture: `operations/parent_execution_payload`.
//!
//! PTC votes start at [`containers::PayloadAttestation`] and
//! [`containers::PayloadAttestationMessage`], then inspect
//! [`containers::BeaconState::process_payload_attestation`] and
//! [`fork_choice::Store::on_payload_attestation_message()`]. Block aggregates and
//! gossip messages are admitted differently, but the store records local PTC vote
//! evidence by position. Fixtures: `operations/payload_attestation`,
//! `fork_choice/on_payload_attestation_message`.
//!
//! Beacon attestation branch choice starts at [`containers::Attestation`], then
//! inspects [`containers::BeaconState::process_attestation`] and
//! [`fork_choice::Store::on_attestation()`]. Votes for a block at `data.slot`
//! stay pending. Votes for an older head use `AttestationData::index` as the
//! payload empty/full selector. Fixtures: `operations/attestation`,
//! `fork_choice/on_attestation`.
//!
//! Head selection starts at [`fork_choice::ForkChoiceNode`], then inspects
//! [`fork_choice::Store::get_head`]. Fork choice returns both a block root and a
//! [`fork_choice::PayloadStatus`]. Fixture: `fork_choice/get_head`.
//!
//! Use [`state_transition`] to follow a block through the rulebook, then use
//! [`containers`] for the data being moved, [`primitives`] and [`constants`] for
//! vocabulary and parameters, [`error`] for the difference between an invalid
//! transition and behavior not yet covered, and [`fork_choice`] for
//! the head-selection rule that reads accepted blocks and attestations to decide
//! which leaf the next block should build on.
//!
//! Build docs with private items when reading this crate as an executable spec:
//! most of the useful phase maps live in private modules because they mirror
//! consensus sub-phases rather than form a public API surface.
//!
//! Coverage boundaries are part of the reading surface. When a consensus branch
//! can be exercised without yet implementing every external verifier, the
//! relevant module docs should name that boundary explicitly.
//!
//! # Hold these distinctions before reading
//!
//! A few distinctions decide whether the rest of the code reads correctly.
//! Hold them before following any route.
//!
//! [`BeaconState`](containers::BeaconState) is durable consensus state, the
//! snapshot validators agree on and carry forward. The fork-choice
//! [`Store`](fork_choice::Store) is one node's local view, the accepted blocks,
//! attestations, and clock that node has seen. The store is bookkeeping for head
//! selection, not consensus state, and two honest nodes can hold different stores.
//!
//! A builder's bid is a commitment, not an accepted payload. Recording the bid
//! promises a payload at a hash, but the payload effects settle only when a child
//! block proves and applies the parent payload commitment.
//!
//! A recorded payload envelope has passed only the consensus-side checks: beacon
//! block roots, required envelope signature, bid-matched payload fields, payload
//! slot, parent execution hash, timestamp, requests root, and withdrawals.
//! Recording it is not an execution-engine validity verdict and not a
//! data-availability verdict.
//!
//! Payload-timeliness votes are indexed by committee position. A gossip message
//! names one validator and expands to the committee positions that validator
//! holds, so the same vote reads as a validator on the wire and as a set of
//! positions in the aggregate.
//!
//! A beacon attestation's `index` is a payload-branch selector only when the voted
//! block is older than `attestation.data.slot`. If the voted block is at
//! `data.slot`, the vote must use the empty/pending form. The two rulebooks then
//! read that selector differently. In state transition, a historical vote's
//! `index` is matched against the `BeaconState` payload-availability bit to
//! decide whether the vote earns its head flag, not whether the vote is accepted.
//! In fork choice, an older full-branch vote is admitted only once the local
//! [`fork_choice::Store::payloads`] map holds the recorded envelope. One shapes a
//! head-flag reward from durable consensus state, the other is a node-local
//! admission gate.
//!
//! A child block applies the parent payload's effects before its own bid. It
//! settles the parent block's promised payload first, then records its own
//! commitment for a later child to prove.
//!
//! # Where this implementation stops
//!
//! The implementation runs the consensus-side rules and stops at the external
//! services a production client would also wire in. Execution-engine payload
//! validity is not checked, so a recorded payload is consensus-checked, not
//! engine-confirmed. Data-availability helpers verify sidecar and cell proof
//! shapes, but there is no sampling scheduler, peer scorer, or custody backfill
//! service. Networking exposes wire constants and topic helpers, but no libp2p
//! host or gossip-validation dispatcher is included.
//! Within those boundaries the code can still exercise the covered consensus
//! branches, including the payload-status branches in fork choice, which is why
//! each affected module names its own boundary in its docs.
