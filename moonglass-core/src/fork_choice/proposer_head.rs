//! The proposer's re-org decision: [`Store::get_proposer_head`] and its guards.
//!
//! Normally a proposer builds its new block on top of the current head. But if
//! the head showed up suspiciously late and looks weakly supported, the honest
//! move can be to skip it and build on its parent instead, a "re-org". This file
//! holds that decision and the safety checks around it: re-org only a single
//! late, weak head whose parent is strongly supported, never across an epoch
//! boundary, never while we are running behind, and never in a way that would
//! set back finality.
//!
//! Parent support is measured against the [`Pending`](super::store::PayloadStatus::Pending)
//! parent node, so support spread across the parent's empty and full payload
//! variants is added together rather than counted against a single variant.
