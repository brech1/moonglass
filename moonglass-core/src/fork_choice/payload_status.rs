//! The empty, full, and pending payload model, and the small helpers that
//! resolve it.
//!
//! To read this file, hold one fact about how [blocks](crate::glossary#beacon-block)
//! are built here. A beacon block (the object [validators](crate::glossary#validator)
//! vote on) and its execution payload (the
//! transactions that actually run) are produced by two different parties and
//! can arrive at different times. A builder promises a payload ahead of time by
//! publishing a signed *bid*, and the payload itself is delivered later in an
//! *envelope*. Because that payload can be late or never arrive, the same block
//! can end up in one of three shapes, which we call its payload status:
//!
//! [`Empty`](PayloadStatus::Empty) is the branch that carries the chain forward
//! without this block's payload, as if this [slot](crate::glossary#slot) carried
//! no transactions. [`Full`](PayloadStatus::Full) is the branch that carries the
//! chain forward on top of this block's payload, once that payload has been
//! delivered. [`Pending`](PayloadStatus::Pending) is not decided yet, because the
//! votes that settle empty versus full have not arrived.
//!
//! Fork choice has to keep these outcomes apart, so a position in the
//! fork-choice tree is a block root paired with one of these statuses (a
//! [`ForkChoiceNode`]), not a block root on its own. The methods here answer
//! the small questions that resolve the status: did a block build on its
//! parent's payload, have we actually received a block's payload, and do the
//! [committee](crate::glossary#committee) votes say the payload was on time with
//! its data available.
//! [`Store::get_head`] and [`weight`](super::weight) build on every one of them.
//!
//! Keep one boundary in mind throughout: recording a payload here means the
//! consensus-side checks passed, required data-column sidecars were verified,
//! and the configured execution verifier accepted it. The default verifier used
//! by reference-test paths accepts every payload, so production callers should
//! supply an execution-engine adapter before treating the full branch as final
//! execution validity.
