//! Error taxonomy for transition code.
//!
//! Every [`TransitionError`] variant means the supplied state or block cannot be
//! accepted by the transition rules implemented here. Coverage boundaries such
//! as execution-engine payload validity and data availability are external
//! verifiers this crate does not model yet, so they carry no variant here.
//!
//! `PrimitivesError` covers operations on primitive protocol values and is
//! surfaced by transition helpers when primitive validation is part of a phase.
