//! Scoring a node: how much support it has, plus the proposer boost.
//!
//! A node's weight is the [stake](crate::glossary#effective-balance) of every
//! [validator](crate::glossary#validator) whose latest vote backs it.
//! Each vote is first resolved to the exact node it supports, then counted if
//! that node lies on the line being scored. On top of that, a freshly proposed
//! [block](crate::glossary#beacon-block) can carry a temporary proposer boost.
//! This file also holds the "weak-head" guard, which asks whether a
//! [head](crate::glossary#head) has so little support that a re-org could fairly
//! replace it.
//!
//! [`head`](super::head) reads these scores to choose the head, and
//! [`proposer_head`](super::proposer_head) reuses the weak-head guard for its
//! re-org decision.
