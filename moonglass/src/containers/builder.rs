//! Builder-market containers.

//! Builders supply execution payloads for proposed beacon blocks. They bid for
//! slots, beacon attestations add the state-transition quorum weight used to
//! release builder payments, and payload-timeliness committee votes feed fork
//! choice's local payload-status evidence. This module models the consensus
//! objects for that builder-supplied payload path.
