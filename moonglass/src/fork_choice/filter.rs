//! Viable-tree filtering before head scoring.
//!
//! The spec is recursive, and this is a recursive transcription with the same
//! semantics. A block is viable when any descendant is viable, OR when the
//! block itself is a leaf whose voting/finalized checkpoints are compatible
//! with the store's current justified and finalized checkpoints.
//! [`get_head`](super::head::get_head) scores only the filtered map, so this is
//! where incompatible branches disappear before weight and payload-status
//! tie-breaks run.
