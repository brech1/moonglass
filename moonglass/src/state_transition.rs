//! Consensus state transition.
//!
//! The transition moves a [`BeaconState`] from one accepted block to the next.
//! It advances empty slots, verifies the proposer's domain-separated signature,
//! applies the block-processing phases, and finally checks that the computed
//! post-state root matches the root claimed by the block.
//!
//! Execution payload envelopes are verified against the bid and expected
//! consensus-side commitments. Execution-engine validity and blob/data
//! availability are not yet implemented.
//!
//! # Reading routes
//!
//! - Block transition: [`BeaconState::apply_signed_block`] clones the pre-state,
//!   runs [`BeaconState::process_slots`], verifies the proposer signature,
//!   applies [`BeaconState::process_block`], checks the claimed post-state root,
//!   then commits the clone back to `self`.
//! - Slot transition: [`BeaconState::process_slots`] repeatedly calls
//!   [`BeaconState::process_slot`], which records recent roots, advances the
//!   clock, clears the payload-availability bit for the next slot, and runs
//!   [`BeaconState::process_epoch`] at epoch boundaries.
//! - Block body transition: [`BeaconState::process_block`] handles the previous
//!   slot's parent payload commitment before accepting the current slot's
//!   builder bid and operations.
//! - Operation transition: [`BeaconState::process_operations`] runs slashings,
//!   beacon attestations, exits, credential changes, and payload
//!   attestations in consensus order.
//!
//! The main functions keep spec shape. Smaller helpers may be named around the
//! state handoff they make visible.
