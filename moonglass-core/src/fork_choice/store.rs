//! The fork-choice [`Store`], the data a node keeps in order to choose a
//! [head](crate::glossary#head).
//!
//! The store is not the blockchain's agreed-upon state. It is one node's private
//! notebook: the [blocks](crate::glossary#beacon-block) it has heard about and
//! the states they produce, who voted for what, which
//! [validators](crate::glossary#validator) cheated, which payloads have arrived,
//! and a clock. Every handler in this module folds new information into the
//! store, and head selection reads it back out. Writing to the store changes
//! only this node's opinion of the head, never the shared chain.
//!
//! # Where each field is written
//!
//! [`get_forkchoice_store`] seeds clock fields,
//! [checkpoints](crate::glossary#checkpoint), anchor block, anchor post-state,
//! checkpoint states, unrealized
//! [justification](crate::glossary#justification-and-finalization), and empty
//! vote/envelope maps.
//!
//! [`on_tick()`](Store::on_tick) advances `time`, resets `proposer_boost_root` at
//! [slot](crate::glossary#slot) boundaries, and realizes pulled-up checkpoints at
//! [epoch](crate::glossary#epoch) boundaries.
//!
//! [`on_block()`](Store::on_block) inserts `blocks`, `block_states`, block
//! timeliness, PTC vote vectors, proposer boost, realized checkpoints,
//! `unrealized_justifications`, and pulled-up checkpoint updates.
//!
//! [`on_attestation()`](Store::on_attestation) updates `checkpoint_states` and
//! `latest_messages`.
//!
//! [`on_attester_slashing()`](Store::on_attester_slashing) updates
//! `equivocating_indices`.
//!
//! [`on_execution_payload_envelope()`](Store::on_execution_payload_envelope)
//! queues unavailable envelopes or inserts into `payloads` after the current
//! consensus-side envelope checks pass.
//!
//! [`on_payload_attestation_message()`](Store::on_payload_attestation_message)
//! updates PTC timeliness and data-availability vote vectors.
