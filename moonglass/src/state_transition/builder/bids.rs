//! Builder bid validation and current-slot bid commitment.
//!
//! The bid path answers one narrow question: may this proposer commit the
//! current slot to this builder's promised payload? If yes, the bid is written
//! into [`BeaconState::latest_execution_payload_bid`] and the builder's pending
//! payment obligation is opened. The payload itself is not accepted here. The
//! envelope path later checks the delivered payload against this commitment, and
//! a child block settles the parent payload's execution requests when it proves
//! the handoff.
